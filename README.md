## About

Backend engineer specializing in high-performance distributed systems and AI infrastructure. I architect scalable pipelines that process millions of events daily, evaluate production ML models, and build robust APIs serving global user bases. Currently focused on bridging the gap between research-grade AI and production-ready systems.

## Professional Focus

**Current Priorities:**
- Architecting low-latency inference pipelines for AI deployments  
- Building event-driven systems handling millions of events daily  
- Establishing MLOps practices: monitoring, versioning, and automated retraining  
- Contributing to foundational Python tooling and AI frameworks  

---

## Open Source

I contribute to projects where reliability and developer experience intersect. Recent contributions focus on:  
- Performance optimizations in async Python frameworks  
- Documentation and testing infrastructure for ML libraries  
- Tooling for distributed system observability  

> *"Production code is read 10x more than it's written. I optimize for the next engineer."*
